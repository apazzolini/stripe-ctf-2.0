## What is this?

These are my solutions to all of the levels of the Stripe CTF 2.0 challenge. There aren't any descriptions or helpful tips anywhere really, but it does contain all of the necessary information to solve the levels with the intended exploits.

The level05-code folder also holds `tamperer.rb`, which is a file that can be used to modify your Sinatra session cookies. This was actually a non-inteded exploit, but worked on both levels 5 and 6.
